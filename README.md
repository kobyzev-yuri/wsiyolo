## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
- Sufficient RAM for large WSI files (8GB+ recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd wsiyolo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare your models**:
   - Place your YOLO model files (.pt) in the `models/` directory
   - The system will automatically detect and configure models

4. **Prepare WSI files**:
   - Place your WSI files (.tiff, .tif, .svs, .ndpi) in the `wsi/` directory

### Basic Usage

#### Single WSI Processing

```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```

This will:
- Process the WSI file in `wsi/19_ibd_mod_S037__20240822_091343.tiff`
- Use all models in the `models/` directory
- Save results to `results/predictions.json`

#### Batch Processing

```bash
python process_all_wsi.py
```

This will:
- Process all WSI files in the `wsi/` directory
- Generate individual result files for each WSI
- Create a summary report

#### Annotated Patch Creation

After running the pipeline, you can create annotated patches with all predictions:

```bash
# Create annotated patches for all predictions
python create_annotated_patches.py
```

This will:
- Extract ALL patches that contain predictions (not just 10-20)
- Create annotated versions with prediction visualizations
- Use grid-based naming: `wsi_name_i_j.png`
- Generate comprehensive visualizations and statistics

#### WSI Overview and Statistics

Create overview visualizations and statistical analysis:

```bash
# Create WSI overview with all predictions
python visualization/create_simple_annotations.py

# View detailed statistics
python visualization/view_statistics.py
```

This will:
- Generate WSI overview images with all predictions overlaid
- Create statistical charts showing class distributions
- Provide detailed analysis of prediction confidence
- Export comprehensive statistics for further analysis

### Patch Naming Convention

Patches are named using the following format:
- **Base WSI name**: Extracted from the WSI filename
- **Grid coordinates**: `_i_j` where i,j are integer patch numbers in the 512x512 grid
- **File extension**: `.png` for annotated patches with predictions

Example: `19_ibd_mod_S037__20240822_091343_23_45.png`
- WSI: `19_ibd_mod_S037__20240822_091343`
- Grid position: patch (23, 45) in the 512x512 grid
- Type: annotated patch with prediction visualizations

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Configuration

Models are automatically configured based on their filenames:

- **lp.pt**: Low-power model (confidence: 0.5)
- **mild.pt**: Mild detection model (confidence: 0.6)
- **moderate.pt**: Moderate detection model (confidence: 0.7)

### Pipeline Parameters

Key parameters can be adjusted in the pipeline initialization:

```python
pipeline = WSIYOLOPipeline(
    models_config=models_config,
    tile_size=512,           # Patch size
    overlap_ratio=0.5,       # Overlap between patches
    iou_threshold=0.5         # IoU threshold for merging
)
```

## 📊 Output Format

### Prediction Results

Results are saved in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "wsi_info": {
    "path": "path/to/wsi.tiff",
    "width": 2048,
    "height": 2048,
    "levels": 4,
    "mpp": 0.25
  },

      "class_name": "tissue_type",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "box": {
        "start": {"x": 100, "y": 100},
        "end": {"x": 200, "y": 200}
      },
      "polygon": [
        {"x": 100, "y": 100},
        {"x": 200, "y": 100},
        {"x": 200, "y": 200},
        {"x": 100, "y": 200}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Statistics

The pipeline provides comprehensive statistics:

- Total number of predictions
- Predictions per class
- Average confidence scores
- Processing time and performance metrics

## 🧠 Technical Details

### Background Detection Algorithms

The pipeline implements multiple background detection strategies:

1. **HSV-based Detection**:
   ```python
   def _is_background_hsv(img, saturation_threshold=30, tissue_ratio=0.1):
       # Converts to HSV and analyzes saturation
       # Uses OTSU thresholding for automatic threshold selection
       # Applies morphological operations for noise reduction
   ```

2. **Grayscale-based Detection**:
   ```python
   def _is_background(img, threshold_value=200, background_ratio=0.99):
       # Simple threshold-based background detection
       # Fast but less accurate for complex images
   ```

### Prediction Merging

The merging algorithm uses geometric operations:

1. **IoU Calculation**: Computes intersection over union for all prediction pairs
2. **Polygon Union**: Uses Shapely library for geometric operations
3. **Confidence Weighting**: Considers confidence scores in final decisions

### Memory Management

- **Lazy Loading**: WSI files are loaded on-demand
- **Patch Streaming**: Large WSI files are processed in chunks
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic cleanup of processed patches

## 🔍 Advanced Usage

### Custom Model Configuration

You can create custom model configurations:

```python
models_config = [
    {
        'model_path': 'path/to/model.pt',
        'window_size': 512,
        'min_conf': 0.6
    }
]
```

### Debugging and Visualization

The pipeline includes debugging tools:

- **Patch Visualization**: View extracted patches
- **Prediction Overlay**: Visualize predictions on WSI
- **Statistics Analysis**: Detailed performance metrics

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Memory Errors**: Reduce `tile_size` or use smaller WSI files
2. **Model Loading Errors**: Ensure model files are compatible with your YOLO version
3. **WSI Loading Errors**: Check WSI file format and ensure MONAI can read it

### Performance Optimization

- Use GPU acceleration when available
- Adjust `overlap_ratio` based on your use case
- Consider using smaller `tile_size` for memory-constrained systems

## 📈 Performance Metrics

Typical performance on a modern GPU:
- **Processing Speed**: ~100-500 patches/second
- **Memory Usage**: 4-8GB for typical WSI files
- **Accuracy**: Depends on model quality and WSI characteristics
